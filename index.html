                            <p>Through user interviews and testing we found that users had trouble navigating the
                                website to find the information they needed. Users were overwhelmed by the amount of
                                information on the website.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>The information architecture of the website was reorganized to create a simpler
                                navigation. The homepage of the website was redesigned to have only the most crucial
                                information and it was laid out in a more accessible way. Overall the redundancies in
                                navigation were fixed for a less confusing experience. </p>

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <div class="part1">
                    <p>I investigated the website to gain more insight on their main purpose. Based on this I created a
                        proto persona to illustrate an example of a possible user. The main audience of the wesite
                        seemed to be researchers and meical professionals based on the heavy emphasison scientific
                        reports and medical data. </p>
                    <img src="images/Proto Persona 1.png" alt="">
                    <p>User interviews were done to investigate the usability of the current website. 5 users were asked
                        to find the cancer page on the website and then to open an article on that page. They were the
                        asked about their overall experience with the website. In addition to the interviews, we did a
                        heuristic analysis and an analysis of the colour scheme for accessibility to pin point how the
                        website was divided and which aspects were crucial to usability.</p>

                <h3>KEY ISSUES:</h3>
                <p>• Users found navigating home from a page confusing </p>

                <p> • One of the colour combinations did not pass accessibility</p>

                <p> • The home page was overwhelming for users </p>

                <p> • A lot of the links such as the covid related information links and the login button went to
                    the same pages and thus were redundant </p>

                <p>• Users were confused about the difference between “Health topics and diseases and conditions”</p>

                <p> • All of the information in items in the “Data and Analyses” tab is also in other pages not
                    under that tab </p>

            </div>
            <div class="ideation">
                <h2>IDEATION AND FIRST PROTOTYPE</h2>
                <p>To begin my redesign I reorganized the information into a site map. I used an open card sort task to
                    help me in this. I only included the items in the primary and secondary navigation in this task as
                    not to overwhelm the participants. 6 participants participated in the card sort and they categorized
                    the items into 4 categories on average.
                </p>
                <img src="images/info architech.png" alt="">
                <p>In the first prototype I focused on making the navigation and home page less confusing and
                    overwhelming based on the issues discovered in user interviews. I categorized the items on the
                    homepage and reduced the amount of reports presented. The idea was that based on grouping the user
                    would be able to find the information they needed in a shorter amount of time. I also got rid of
                    some of the redundancies in navigation to make the path to a specific page more clear and reduce the
                    amount of categories in the navigation. For example, the ‘Data and Analysis’ tab included the same
                    categories as the other items in the primary navigation. For this reason I eliminated this category
                    and decided to include a “Data and Analysis” section on the actual topic pages.

                    <h2>VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>To update the visuals of the website I generated a style guide for the new design. I aimed to
                        keep some of the branding from the first website but make it cleaner and more approachable.
                        Users did not find the existing colour scheme unappealing so I kept it pretty similar for the
                        redesign. The purple, however, seemed to clash with the rest of the colours so I omitted it,
                        simplifying the colour scheme. The concept of the style was to make the site feel professional
                        and scientific. I also made a new logo for the site to make it look more professional as well as
                        being more modern. In this step I created the grids for the desktop version as well as for the
                        mobile to make the responsive design consistent. I went with a 12 column design for the desktop
                        and a 4 column design for the mobile for flexibility in laying out the different types of
                        elements on both platforms.

                        a lot of white space and minimized the amount of colours used. I also went through a few ideas
                        for the home page before landing on the final one.

                        the desktop and the mobile prototype. They first needed to find the injuries page, then the
                        poison page. They then needed to be able to return to the injuries page and then back home. In
                        the second task they needed to find the COVID-19 data tool and favourite the page. </p>

                    <h3>SUMMARY</h4>
                        <p>
                            The way the information on the Public Health Ontario website was organized was overwhelming
                            and confusing for users. Through this redesign I focused on reorganizing the website to make
                            the navigation easier for the user. I simplified the colour scheme, redesigned the logo and
                            paired down the navigation. Following the user testing I added a new feature in the form of
                            “Read Later” tab at the top of the page to indicate where to find favourited items. In the
                            next steps the website can be further improved by applying the UI to more pages.
                            Additionally, there could be more microinteractions added to make the experience of using
                            the website more delightful.
                        </p>
                </div>

                <div class="whatilearned">
                    <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
                    <p>In this project I not only got to consider the user but also the organization. I was challenged
                        by the amount of information that needed to be on the website and how to organize it all in a
                        way that would be accessible to the user. I implemented the card sort task which helped a lot in
                        doinf that. This is something I plan to keep doing in future projects.
                        I also found that users often tried to use the search button instead of the primary navigation
                        to try to find an article. I feel that for the fututre it would be good to consider this and
                        implement changes to the search button which may make it even more user friendly.
                        Additionally this was my first time coming up with an entire style guide and I made the mistake
                        of not saving the pieces of it as components right away to use in my prototype. This made my
                        prototyping process less efficient than I would have liked. I am now aware of the importance of
                        saving pieces of the design as components to make quick iterations. </p>
